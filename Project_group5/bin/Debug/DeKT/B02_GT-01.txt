Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate 
the correct answer to each of the questions from 31 to 35

   Universities love overseas students – they are clever and hardworking, they bring different cultures 
to seminars and student life and they pay their way. In Britain, universities are getting ready to 
enroll more overseas students. The British Council has published a report predicting that overseas 
student numbers could soar to more than 800,000 by 2018. In 2010, figures put the total at over 400,000 
international students out of two and a half million students in UK higher education and it is clear 
that this influx is having an enormous impact on universities and colleges.

   These students bring welcome fees, of course, but they are also likely to be very intelligent 
students who inject new cultural influences and bring changes to the old university systems. Their demand 
for vocational subjects such as business, biotechnology and information technology, rather than traditional 
academic subjects, is affecting what is taught as well.

   The impressive expansion of foreign students has already had a significant impact on higher education. 
Overseas student numbers, including European Union students, have risen from 270,000 in 2002 to 400,000 
in 2010. During this time the number from China jumped more than tenfold, and numbers from India have 
been going up. In contrast, the number of students from other countries has fallen, reflecting their 
governments’ efforts to educate more of their young people at home, as well as competition from Australia 
and the USA. But as the Asian tiger economies expand their own universities, the good news for places like 
the London School of Economics is that there are more and more graduates looking to improve their qualifications 
or to pursue research in their subjects.
